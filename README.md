# Data-Science-Final-Project
COVID-19 Deaths Analysis (2020–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 death data to better understand how the pandemic affected different groups of people in the United States. Using data from the CDC, I looked at COVID-19 deaths by age group, sex, time period, and state. The goal of this project is to identify patterns in the data and determine which groups were most impacted by COVID-19.

This project would be useful for public health agencies or anyone interested in understanding the demographic impact of COVID-19.

## Dataset
- Source: CDC Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age  
- Years Covered: 2020–2023  
- File Type: CSV  

Each row in the dataset represents aggregated COVID-19 death counts by age group, sex, month, year, and state.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas (for data cleaning and analysis)  
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and documenting the analysis)

## Questions Explored
1. How did COVID-19 deaths differ between males and females across age groups?
2. How did COVID-19 deaths change month-to-month within age groups?
3. Which age groups accounted for the largest share of total COVID-19 deaths?
4. Which states experienced the highest total number of COVID-19 deaths?
5. Which age and sex groups accounted for the highest number of COVID-19 deaths?

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 deaths increased as age increased.
- Males generally experienced higher death counts than females across most age groups.
- Death counts changed over time, with clear spikes during major parts of the pandemic.
- A small number of states accounted for a large portion of total COVID-19 deaths.
- Older males were the most impacted demographic group overall.

## Future Work
If this project were continued, future analysis could compare death counts to population size and examine how vaccination rates affected COVID-19 deaths. It would also be interesting to explore why certain states were more heavily impacted than others.
